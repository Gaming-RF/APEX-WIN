//! macOS Tier 1/2: filesystem (and, for Tier 2, network) isolation via
//! Apple's Seatbelt sandbox (`sandbox-exec` + SBPL profiles).
//!
//! This is the macOS analogue of `tier1.rs` (Landlock) and `tier2.rs`
//! (bubblewrap). It is NOT equivalent to either: Seatbelt has no mount or
//! PID namespace, no resource limits, and the confined process still runs
//! as the same user with the same visible process table. What it does
//! provide, and what these two tiers rely on, is a real MAC (mandatory
//! access control) boundary enforced by the XNU kernel: a `(deny default)`
//! profile that denies every filesystem write and, for Tier 2, every
//! network operation except what is explicitly allowed. That boundary
//! cannot be bypassed by the sandboxed process itself, the same property
//! Landlock and bubblewrap provide on Linux, just with a smaller set of
//! resources actually confined.
//!
//! `sandbox-exec` is deprecated by Apple with no public replacement for
//! confining arbitrary third-party binaries (App Sandbox requires the
//! binary opt in via entitlements, which a Windows .exe running under Wine
//! cannot do). It remains the only mechanism available, and is used in
//! production by Chrome, OpenAI Codex and Gemini CLI for exactly this kind
//! of untrusted-subprocess confinement — see HANDOFF.md for the sources
//! this was verified against before relying on it here.
//!
//! ## Profile design
//!
//! Both tiers use `(deny default)` plus a minimal allowlist, mirroring
//! `tier1.rs`'s Landlock ruleset:
//!   - `file-read*`: unrestricted, matching Landlock Tier 1's intent (Wine
//!     needs to read broadly across `/usr`, `/opt`, frameworks, fonts, etc.
//!     and enumerating all of that up front is both impractical and not
//!     the property either tier is trying to enforce — the write side is).
//!   - `file-write*`: scoped to the resolved Wine prefix and a per-launch
//!     temp directory only. This is the actual isolation boundary.
//!   - `process-exec`/`process-fork`: required for `wineserver` and its
//!     subprocesses, which the parent Wine process spawns. Seatbelt
//!     profiles are inherited by children (confirmed against a real
//!     production profile before this was written), so this one rule
//!     covers the whole process tree, the same way Landlock's
//!     `restrict_self()` does.
//!   - Network: Tier 1 allows it (matching Landlock Tier 1, which also
//!     cannot fully block network — see tier1.rs's own doc comment); Tier 2
//!     denies it outright, which Seatbelt CAN do completely (unlike
//!     Landlock), making Tier 2 here strictly more capable on the network
//!     axis than Linux's own Tier 1.
